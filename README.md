# Usage
### Linux
  1. Install git, java (only the runtime is necessary), and cmake (>= v3.0).
    - Until now, cmake has found the dependencies without issues. If you
      encounter an issue, let me know and we can fix it.
  1. Make a directory that you intend to build the project in and change into
     that directory.
  1. Run `cmake <path-to-ANTLR-Base>`.
  1. Run `make`.
  1. Done.
